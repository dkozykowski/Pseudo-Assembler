# Pseudo-Assembler Simulator

This project is an interpreter and simulator for the pseudo-assembly language 
designed by prof. Homenda. 
The program reads list of commands with arguments
from a file, simulates them and lets user see changes made by every single
command. It was made to help students understand how does a binary program work.

**Take a look at [documentation](documentation.pdf) for manuals, instructions for begginers and
pseudo-assembly language structure**
